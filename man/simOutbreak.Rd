\arguments{
\item{R0}{the basic reproduction number; to use several groups, provide a
vector with several values.}

\item{infec.curve}{a \code{numeric} vector describing the individual
infectiousness at time t=0, 1, \dots{}}

\item{n.hosts}{the number of susceptible hosts at the begining of the
outbreak}

\item{duration}{the number of time steps for which simulation is run}

\item{seq.length}{an integer indicating the length of the simulated
haplotypes, in number of nucleotides.}

\item{mu.transi}{the rate of transitions, in number of mutation per site and
per time unit.}

\item{mu.transv}{the rate of transversions, in number of mutation per site
and per time unit.}

\item{rate.import.case}{the rate at which cases are imported at each time
step.}

\item{diverg.import}{the number of time steps to the MRCA of all imported
cases.}

\item{group.freq}{the frequency of the different groups; to use several
groups, provide a vector with several values.}

\item{spatial}{a logical indicating if a spatial model should be used.}

\item{disp}{the magnitude of dispersal (standard deviation of a normal
distribution).}

\item{area.size}{the size of the square area to be used for spatial
simulations.}

\item{reach}{the mean of the exponential kernel used to determine new
infections.}

\item{plot}{a logical indicating whether an animated plot of the outbreak
should be displayed; only available with the spatial model.}

\item{stop.once.cleared}{a logical indicating if the simulation should stop
when the global force of infection is close to zero (<10^-12); TRUE by default.}

\item{x, object}{\code{simOutbreak} objects.}

\item{\dots}{further arguments to be passed to other methods}

\item{i, j, drop}{\code{i} is a vector used for subsetting the object. For
instance, \code{i=1:3} will retain only the first three haplotypes of the
outbreak. \code{j} and \code{drop} are only provided for compatibility, but
not used.}

\item{edge.col}{the color of the edges of the plotted graph; overridden by
\code{col.edge.by}.}

\item{col.edge.by}{a character indicating the type of information to be used
to color the edges; currently, the only valid value is "dist" (distances, in
number of mutations). Other values are ignored.}

\item{vertex.col}{the colors to be used for the vertices (i.e., cases).}

\item{edge.col.pal}{the color palette to be used for the edges; if NULL, a
grey scale is used, with darker shades representing larger values.}

\item{annot}{a character indicating the information to be used to annotate
the edges; currently accepted values are "dist" (genetic distances, in
number of mutations), and "n.gen" (number of generations between cases).}

\item{sep}{a character used to separate fields used to annotate the edges,
whenever more than one type of information is used for annotation.}

\item{y}{present for compatibility with the generic 'plot' method. Currently
not used.}

\item{col}{the color of the vertices of the plotted graph.}

\description{
The function \code{simOutbreak} implements simulations of disease outbreaks.
The infectivity of cases is defined by a generation time distribution. The
function \code{as.igraph} allows to convert simulated transmission trees
into \code{igraph} objects.
