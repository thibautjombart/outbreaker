# outbreaker
*Disease outbreak reconstruction from epidemiological and genetic data*

Welcome to the project page of *outbreaker*!
This page is dedicated to the development of the R package *outbreaker*.
Whenever possible, it is recommended to use the development version of the package rather than the older CRAN version. The devel version (at least the master branch) is meant to be as functional as the CRAN version, but integrates the latest new features and bug fixes.

For documentation and tutorials, see [The R-epi-project](https://sites.google.com/site/therepiproject/r-pac/outbreaker).


Installing *outbreaker*
-------------
To install the development version from github (the package *devtools is required*):

```r
library(devtools)
install_github("thibautjombart/outbreaker")
```

The stable version can be installed from CRAN using:

```r
install.packages("outbreaker")
```

Then, to load the package, use:

```r
library("outbreaker")
```
